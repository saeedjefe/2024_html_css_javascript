The given line graph compares grams of fish and diffenet types of meat consumed in a European country over a 25-year
period lasting from 1979 to 2004. 

Overall, the trend in chicken consumption was upward, while lamb consumption showed a downward
movement. Conversely, beef consumption exhibited volatility, whereas fish consumption remained
constant. 

Chicken consumption, having stood at 140 grams per person per week  in 1979, experienced a significant increase of
100 grams over the next 25 years, reaching almost 250 grams in 2004. On the other hand, lamb started at 140 grams in
1979, and after a considerable decline of 90 grams, hit an all-time low of 60 grams in 2004. 

Conversely, being the most consumed meat, lamb stood at 220 in 1979, although it dipped to 180 grams
in 1982. Thereafter, however, it rebounded to its initial level before experiencing a substantial
decline leading to an all-time low of 100 grams in 2004. In contrast, fish, being constantly the
lest eaten type of meat overall, remained unchanged at approximately 50 grams over the period in
question.
