The maps depict and  industrial distric in Norbiton town, with the top diagram
illustrating the current lauyout and the  bottom showing the proposed development.

The zone is set to undergo massive changes:the introduction of a medical center,
shops, a playground, and a school to the area, the replacement of factories by housing, the
building of new roads leading into the farmaland, and the
installation of a new roundabout at the very south of the area.

The area is heavily industrilized at the moment, with one roundabout in the
center, numerous factories lining the east road and the roundabout itself, a
high way to the south, and an isolated farmland to the north with no means of transportation. 

However, the factories are propoesed to be replaced by houseing, with the
incoporation of shops and a medical center to the south-west and south-east  of
the central roundabout, respectively. Additionally, the construction of a school
at the very end of the east road and a play ground to the south of the river
are two other plans decided for the Norbiton industrial area, while the north of
the city will also experience some significant modifications. Indeed, to the
north of the roundabout will lay a dead-end road, having crossed the river
leading into the farmland. Additionally, to the nort-west of the central square, a
short road will be erected.
