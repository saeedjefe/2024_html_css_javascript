The given plans depict Souhtwest aiport, with the first diagram illustrating the
current site and the second showing the proposed redevelopment.

The total area of the airport is set to increase so that it can feature new
services such as sky train feature at its rear and a hire car  and bag drop
sector.

Located at fron left of the airport is a departure lounge, with an exit at the
front, a check-in area near the back left-hand corner and a cafe in the back
right-hand corner. Adjacent to the departure lounge is located an arrival lounge at
on whose front side is also an entrance. Behind the arrival and departure
lounges lie Passport Control Customs and Security Passport Control areas,
respectively. Behind these areas are two trapiziod-shaped hallways ending at a
rectangular area inside of which lie two walk ways inlined with 8 gates.

The airport is set to undergo significant changes: the addition of two gates to
the lounges, a remarkable increase in the number of gates from 8 to 17 leading
to a Y-shape extension at the rear of the aiport, and the introduction of some
custome friendly services. Indeed, an ATM is planned to be installed on the
right side of departure lounge, with a cafe to its back and a car hire service
to its frontm, while a bagdrop in the rear left-hand corner of the departure
lounge will be introduced.
