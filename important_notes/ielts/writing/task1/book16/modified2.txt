The given plans depict Souhtwest airport, with the first diagram illustrating the
current site and the second showing the proposed redevelopment.

The total area of the airport is set to increase so that it can feature new
services such as sky train system, a hire car  service and a bag drop.

Located at front left of the airport is a departure lounge, with an exit at the
front, a check-in area near the back left-hand corner and a cafe in the back
right-hand corner. Adjacent to the departure lounge is located an arrival lounge 
on whose front side is also an entrance. Behind the arrival and departure
lounges lie Passport Control Customs and Security Passport Control areas,
respectively. Behind these areas are two trapiziod-shaped hallways ending at a
rectangular area inside which lie two walk ways inlined with 8 gates.

The airport is set to undergo significant changes: the addition of an exit and entrance to
the lounges, a remarkable increase in the number of gates from 8 to 17 leading
to a Y-shape extension at the rear of the aiport, and the introduction of some
customer-friendly services. Indeed, an ATM is planned to be installed on the
right side of departure lounge, with a cafe  and a car hire service behind and in front of it, 
respectively, while a bag drop in the rear left-hand corner of the departure lounge will be 
introduced.
