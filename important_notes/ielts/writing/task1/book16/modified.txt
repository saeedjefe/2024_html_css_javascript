The plans depict the layout of Southwest airport with the left one showing the
current site and the right one the redeveloped version. 

The total area of the airport will be expanded to include sky train system and a
car hire service.

With the Security Passport Control area behind, the departure lounge is at the
front left of the airport having a main exit on the front side, a check-in
area near the back left-hand corner, and a cafe in the back right-hand corner.
To the right of the departure lounge is the arrival lounge, with a main entrance
at the front side and Possport Control Customs area behind.
To the right of the Passport Control Customs is Security Passport Control, with
a  trapeziod-shaped hallway located behind them.
At the back of the Soutwest airport is a rectangular area in which there are two
walkways, lined with eight gates.

In a year, the airpot will undergo massive changes:
the addition of car hire service, a dramatic rise in the number of gates from 8 to 18 leading to the
creation of a Y-shape at the end of the airport. 
 
The check-in area, having moved to near back right-hand coner of the departure
lounge, will give way to a bag drop, with the cafe being planned to  relocate to
the back right-hand corner of the arrival lounge to the right side of which an
ATM will be added. The building of shops in the hallway at back of the airport and the addition of
a new entrance and an exit to the arrival and departure lounges, repectively, are also worth
mentioning.
