Tehranian Polymath is an ambitious project whose purpose is promoting the notion of polymathy, the capacity or practice of acquiring knowledge and expertise across a wide a range of fields.

<section id=why_IELTS>
<h2><strong>Why IELTS!!</strong></h2>
Living in a word where specialization is highly encouraged, most people find it unnecessary to learn about a wide
range of fields. Therefore, we needed an excuse to encourage our audience to know, read, write, and speak about
almost everything. We have found no excuses other than Academic IELTS, the most popular English Language test, with
...sitting for the test annualy.

<h2><strong>Approach</strong></h2>

<b>Reading</b><br>

<p>Become a linguist and a philosepher reader!!!</p><br>
<p>
No matter what you read, as a polymath, you should enjoy reading as long as, linguisically speaking, the passage is
written professionally. With the CEO of Tehranian polymath having struggled with
and worked on simplifying academic reading passages for almost 14 years now,
using linguisitic and philoshphic principles, we beilive that what you will learn
from Tehranian Polymath can change your life for ever. We are confident saying that because we have already solved
the problem, with dozens of students, at least, not hating the most difficult IELTS reading
passages anymore. This doesn't mean, nevertheless, that we guarantee a particular
reading band score, nor do we claim that your reading band score will improve
immediately. However, your adoption of a new preception of reading difficult
passages may result in a major boost to your confidence, with joy, hopefully,
replacing hatred when it comes to decoding passages. The good news is that you 
will acquire these linguisitic and philosophic skills while answering IELTS questions. Therefore, your preparation
for the IELTS exam can be simultanous with your journey to becomming a polymath.
That's why we beilieve that Tehranian Polymath is going to make a differnece.

<b>Writing</b><br>

<p>I have become a linguist and philosopher reader. Now what??</p><br>
<p>
As a linguist and a philosopher reader, you are absolutely ready to start
writing. But even if you have fundamental linguisitic and philosophic skills, you may have a hard time learning how 
to think . Indeed, Thinking is a cognitive function whose difficulty
may even surpass fundamental language skills. Thinking requires not only
practice but also knowledge consisting of words and collocations. But how to gain knowlege, practice thinking, and 
articulate the gained knowledge immediately, while taking care of accquired linguisitic skills??
Well, the CEO of Tehranian Polymath has been nursing the this ambition, having
aleardy invented some strategies, and, thankfully, the strategies have been
shown to work. Nevertheless, this is an ongoing process, with your collaboration
being welcomed. 
</p>




<b>Speaking</b><br>

Finally, a well-read, thoughtful writer whose expertise include linguisitics and 
philosohphy shall speak, answering IELTS questions. 
speak, impressing the audience.
