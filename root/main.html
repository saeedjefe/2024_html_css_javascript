<h2><strong><a href=/home/the-polymath/2024/tehranian_polymath/html_css_javascript/root/content/ielts/ielts.html>Why IELTS!!</a></strong></h2>
Living in a world where specialization is highly encouraged, most people find it
unnecessary to opt out of the rat race, trying to read, write, and speak about almost
everything thoughtfully. In the IELTS exam, on the other hand, folks are pushed
out of their comfort zones, being asked to read Academic Passages and talk and
write about unfamiliary topics, with their linguistic skills being constantly
evaluated. Therefore, Tehranian Polymath aims to make the most of this
opportunity, creating well-rounded candidates whose knowledge in linguistics
is absolutely outstanding.

<h1><ul><strong>Approach</strong></ul></h1>

<li><a href=
/home/the-polymath/2024/tehranian_polymath/html_css_javascript/root/content/ielts/reading/ielts-reading.html>
Reading is the first step!!</a></li>
<p>No matter what you read, as a polymath, you should enjoy reading as long as a
passage is linguisitically professional. Since the CEO of Tehranian polymath has
been  struggling with the simplifying of academic reading passages for almost 14 years now,
having used linguisitic and philosophic principles, we beilive that what you will learn
from Tehranian Polymath can change your life for ever. We are confident saying that because we have already solved
the problem, with dozens of students, at least, not hating the most difficult IELTS reading
passages anymore. This doesn't mean, nevertheless, that we guarantee a particular
reading band score, nor do we claim that your reading band score will improve
immediately. However, your adoption of a new preception of reading difficult
passages may result in a major boost to your confidence, with joy, hopefully,
replacing hatred when it comes to decoding passages. The good news is that you 
will acquire these linguisitic and philosophic skills while answering IELTS questions. Therefore, your preparation
for the IELTS exam can be simultanous with your journey to becomming a polymath.
That's why we beilieve that Tehranian Polymath is going to make a differnece.

<li>Having become a linguist and philosopher reader, you are ready to write.</li>
</p>As a linguist and a philosopher reader, you are absolutely ready to start
writing. But the ability to think deeply and critically is a prerequisite to
write. In fact, even if you have fundamental linguisitic and philosophic skills, you may have a hard time learning
how to think. Indeed, thinking is a cognitive function whose difficulty
may even surpass fundamental language skills. Thinking requires not only
practice but also knowledge consisting of words and collocations. But how to gain knowlege, practice thinking, and 
articulate the gained knowledge immediately, while taking care of accquired linguisitic skills??
Well, the CEO of Tehranian Polymath has been nursing this ambition, having
aleardy invented some strategies, and, thankfully, the strategies have been
shown to work. Nevertheless, this is an ongoing process, with your collaboration
being welcomed.</p>
<li>Having become a knowledgeable writer, you are ready to talk</li>
<p>Finally, a well-read, thoughtful writer whose expertise include linguisitics and 
philosohphy shall speak, answering IELTS questions. 
Speak, impressing the examiner.</p>
