Purpose:
Tehranian Polymath is an ambitious project whose purpose is promoting the notion of polymathy, the capacity or practice of acquiring knowledge and expertise across a wide a range of fields.  

Why IELTS:
Living in a word where specialization is highly encouraged, most people find it unnecessary to learn about a wide
range of fields. Therefore, we needed an excuse to encourage our audience to know, read, write, and speak about
almost everything. We have found no excuse better than Academic IELTS, the most popular English Language test, with
...sitting for the test annualy.  

Method:
Although open to suggestions, new ideas, and innovations, Tehranian Polymath is mainly focused on linguistic and
congnitive tools, while analyzing and, consequently, answering IELTS sample questions. I  do warn you, though, that 
this is not going to be a typical IELTS approach, often seen in other platforms. Instead, your learning the most
fundmental aspects of modern English will be simultanous with your preparing for the IELTS exam. 

Reading:
chunking
flowcharts
patterns


writing & speaking :
using chunks in flowcharts to write
reverse engineering 


To make that possible, Tehranian Polymath shows you how important chunking can be when it comes to answering IELTS
reading questions.
