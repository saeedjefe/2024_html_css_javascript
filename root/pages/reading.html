The importance of Phrase Chunking in IELTS Reading 

Are you able to identify phrases in an IELTS reading passage? Did you know that no matter how difficult a passage is, it is only made up of three types of phrases, period,?

 
Did you know that only one part of these phrases is almost always the answer to all the "sentence completion" and "diagram labeling" questions. 
Did you know that this "one part" accounts for only (almost)35% of reading passages. Look at the following sample from IETLS 11(ACADEMIC). To answer questions 20 to 26, read the last three paragraphs on your own. Then, having answered the questions, keep scrolling down because I am going to prove the points I have just made in my previous sentences. 
  
But if that's the case, why no one is talking about it. Well, this is because identifying this piece of puzzle and consequently three types of phrases is not as straightforward as it seems to be.
 
Based on my experience, under direct supervison of a teacher who has considerable expertise in syntax, it typicall takes a student one month to recognize these phrases, regardless of his/her English language level. I have written this article in which two congnitive models, metaphor and schema, are used so that your understaning of them becomes deep enough to start identifying these phrases in
reading passages immediately.
