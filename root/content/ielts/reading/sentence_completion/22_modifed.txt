Test 1



Boats needing to be lifted up enter the
canal basin at the level of the Forth &
Clyde Canal and then enter the lower
gondola of the Wheel. Two hydraulic steel
gates are raised, so as to seal the gondola
off from the water in the canal basin. The
water between the gates is then pumped
out. A hydraulic clamp, which prevents
the arms of the Wheel moving while the
gondola is docked, is removed, allowing
the Wheel to turn. In the central machine
room an array of ten hydraulic motors
then begins to rotate the central axle. The
axle connects to the outer arms of the

Wheel, which begin to rotate at a speed
of 1/8 of a revolution per minute. As the
wheel rotates, the gondolas are kept in
the upright position by a simple gearing
system. Two eight-metre-wide cogs orbit
a fixed inner cog of the same width,
connected by two smaller cogs travelling
in the opposite direction to the outer cogs
- so ensuring that the gondolas always
remain level. When the gondola reaches
the top, the boat passes straight onto the
aqueduct situated 24 metres above the
canal basin.

The remaining 11 metres of lift needed
to reach the Union Canal is achieved by
means of a pair of locks. The Wheel could
not be constructed to elevate boats over
the full 35-metre difference between the
two canals, owing to the presence of the
historically important Antonine Wall, which
was built by the Romans in the second
century AD. Boats travel under this wall via
a tunnel, then through the locks, and finally
on to the Union Canal.
