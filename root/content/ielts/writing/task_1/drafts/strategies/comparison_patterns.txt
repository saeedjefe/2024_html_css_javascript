One of the main concerns of Academic IELTS test-takers is the variety and
complexity of task_1 questions for which they should memorize many unsual
collocations addressing statistical subjects. Therefore, thanks to books and
some teachers, these collocations have been broken down into categories based 
on the type of statistical illustrations, namely bar charts, pie charts, tables,
line graphs. However, this approach may debilitate our cognitive ability
regrading the analysis of statistical information since the classifications go
beyong the type of statistical medium used for conveying data. Therefore, I
created a new way of grouping collocations and describing statistical data which
is called "comparison_patterns" which is not based on the type of a statistical
medium but rather on our perception, understanding and thinking of the data.
