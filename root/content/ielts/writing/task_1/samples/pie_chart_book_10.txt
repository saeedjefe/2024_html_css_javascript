The top pie chart gives information on the means by which energy is used in average Australian
household, with the bottom pie chart comparing the percentages of greenhouse gas emitted by such means. 


The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating at a hefty 42 %, followed by water
heating with 30%. The figure for other appliances, on the other hand, is half that of water
heating, with refrigeration, lighting, and cooling representing a mere 7%,4%, and 2% of the total, respectively. 

32 percent of Australian household greenhouse gas is emitted by water heating, while cooling and
lightening account for only a tiny 3% and 8%. It is also worth mentioning that other appliances are
responsible for a third of emissions in Australia, with the figure for refrigeration being half of
that. 

Overall, the proportion of emssions produced by refrigeration and other appliances are twice as big as their
figures concering energy use; in contrast, heating's contribution to gas emissions is a third of its
energy use.
