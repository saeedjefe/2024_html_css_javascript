The top pie chart gives information on the distribution of energy use in an avergage Australinan 
household, with the bottom pie chart comparing the proportion of greenhouse gas emssions stemming
from this energy use. 


The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used for heating at 42 %, followed by water
heating, at 30%. The figure for other appliances, on the other hand, is half that of water
heating, with refrigeration, lighting, and cooling representing 7%,4%, and 2% of the total, respectively. 

32 percent of  greenhouse gas emissions in Australia result from  water heating, while cooling and
lighting account for 3% and 8%, respectively. Additionally, other appliances are responsible for a
third of emissions in this country, with the figure for refrigeration being half of that. 

Overall, refrigeration and other appliances cause a disproportionate amount of gas emissions, twice as big as their
figures concering energy use; in contrast, heating's contribution to gas emissions is a third of its
use of energy.
