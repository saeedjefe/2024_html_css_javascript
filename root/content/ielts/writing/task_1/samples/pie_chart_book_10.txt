The top pie chart gives information on the means by which energy is used in average Australian
household, with the bottom pie chart comparing the percentages of greenhouse gas emitted by such means. 


The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating at 42 %, followed by water
heating at 30%. The figure for other appliances, on the other hand, is half that of water
heating, with refrigeration, lighting, and cooling representing 7%,4%, and 2% of the total, respectively. 

32 percent of  greenhouse gas emissions in Australia result from  water heating, while cooling and
lighting lead to 3% and 8%, respectively. Additionally, other appliances are responsible for a third of emissions in Australia, with the figure for refrigeration being half of that. 

Overall, refrigeration and other appliances cause a disproportionate amount of gas emissions, twice as big as their
figures concering energy use; in contrast, heating's contribution to gas emissions is a third of its
use of energy.
