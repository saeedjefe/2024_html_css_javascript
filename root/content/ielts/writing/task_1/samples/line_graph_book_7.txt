The line graph gives information on  how many grams of four different types of meat consumed in a
European country over a 25-year period lasting from 1979 to 2004.

Overall, an upward trend was observed in chicken consumption, while lamb consumption showed a
downward movement. Conversely, fish consumption remained constant, whereas that of beef exhibited volatility.

In 1979, although chicken and lamb were eaten at similar quantities at 150 per person per week, they
followed different patterns over the period in question, with lamb plunging to almost 50 grams and 
chicken surging to almost 250 grams. Indeed, by 2004 chicken had become the most popular meat.

In contrast, even though beef was the most eaten meat at 2010 grams per person per week in 1979, this rate
fluctuated wildly over the next 10 years, reaching almost 180 grams in 1989. After this period of
volatility, beef consumption continued to decrease, reaching an all time low of approximately 100 
grams. However, fish, being the least consumed meat over the period in question, remained
unchanged at 50 grams from 1979 to 2004.
