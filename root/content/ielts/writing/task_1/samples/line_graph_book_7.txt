The line graph gives information on  how many grams of four different types of meat consumed in a
European country over a 25-year period lasting from 1979 to 2004.

Overall, an upward trend was observed in chicken consumption, while lamb consumption showed a
downward movemnt. Conversely, fish consumption remained constant, whereas that of beef exhibited volitality.

In 1979, although chicken and lamb were eaten at similar quantites at 150 per person perweek, they
followed different patterns over the period in quesion, with lamb plunging to almost 50 grams and
chicken surging to almost 150 grams. 

In contrast, even though beef was the most eaten meat at 2010 grams per person per week in 1979, this rate
fluctuated videly over the next 10 years, reaching almost 180 grams in 1989. After this period of
volatility, beef consumption continued to decrease, reaching an all time low of approximately 100
grams. In contrast, fish, being the least consumed meat over the period inquestion, remained
unchanged at 50 grams from 1979 to 2004.
