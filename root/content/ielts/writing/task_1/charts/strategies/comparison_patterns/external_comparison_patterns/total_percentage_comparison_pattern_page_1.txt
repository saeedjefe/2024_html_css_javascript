Total Percentage Comparison Pattern:


In order to tackle the process of describing pie charts smartly, you should find the patterns being
repeated in the sentences describing statistical information represented in this medium.
Tehranina Polymath has identified the algorithms whose sequences create the pattern, labelled Total
Percentage Comparison Pattern.

There are three algorithms which are most frequently used in this type of pattern. 

first: percent based description
the formula:
the percent + of + the whole + the bridge + the item

second: percentage based description
the formula:

third: item base description
the formula:

Going through IELTS samples, you will learn thses algorithms with which you can boot your morale. 

Percent Based Description

Book 10, Test 1


step 1: 
*extract the main topic and call it 'the whole'
the whole = 'Australina household energy use'
step 2:
*reverse-engineer the whole if need
'Australian household energy use' is a quiet complicated noun phrase. So let's make it simple using
'reverse-eginneering'. 
reverse-engineering: converting a noun phrase into an abstract noun phrase.
To do that, you should find the most right noun and find out whether its origin is a verb.
With the right most noun being 'use', we are pretty sure that the root is a verb. 
The next step is to bring it to the beginning of the phrase and add a specific determiner, in this
case 'the',  to it. 
the use of Australian household energy
step 3:
needing a clause(subject + verb) to answer this task one question, we should convert this abstract
noun phrase into a clause. To do that, we should a have subject. Let's find out whether we extract a
subject from this abstract noun phrase. 
the use of Australian household energy
'of Australian household enery' could be both the subject in 'of phrase form' and the object in 'of phrase
form. Eihter away, we should get rid of the and see 'use' as a verb 
Let try both of them:
subject: Australian household energy is used
object: * use Australian household enery.
It is a good idea to stick with the subject option so that we don't make the process harder by
adding a new word to this. Therefore, let's assign it to the whole varible. 
the whole = Australian household energy is used
step 4:
Now, let's find the second variable in our alorithm. Looking at the pie chart, you may choose
heating, cooling, lighting, water heating, refrigeration, or other appliances.
Let's choose 'heating' and assing it to a variable called item. 
item = heating
step 5:
In this stage, we should build the 'bridge'.
To do that, we should figure the context in which statistical data is being represented. 
Thankfully, the number of pie charts'contexts is limited. I am going to introduce them to you one at
a time. Look at the question:'The first chart below shows how energy is used'. The word 'how'
indicates the context. 'how' is a clear sign of means or methods. 
The propositions that describe 'means' are as follows: by/via/through/with/by dint of/by means of
In our case 'by' seems to be the best option. Let's pick this one over others.
bridge = by
the whole + the bridge + the item
Australian household energy is used + by + heating
step 6:
In the final stage, we should fit the last piece of puzzle by looking a the proportion of heating
which is 42%.
the percent+ of + the whole(clause) + the bridge + the item
42% + of Australian household energy is used + by + heating.
Now, let's write our sentence:
42% of Australian household energy is used by heating. 

done

Percentage Based Description:

step 1:

the whole(noun phrase) + the adjectival bridge + the item 
Australian household energy +  which is used by + heating

step 2:
the whole(noun phrase) + the reduced adjectival bridge + the item
Australian household energy + used by + heating

step 3:
adding the subject and the verb to create a clause
the percentage + of + the whole + the adjectival bridge + the item + linking verbs + percent
the percentage + of + Australian household energy + used by heate + stands at/is + 42%.


Item Based Description:

the item + CCHWCB + percent + of + the whole

Figure Based Description:

The figure for + item + linking verbs + the percent

*figure the context
*build the bridge
*add percent before the whole


*add the percentage of before the whole
*modify the whole by the item
*put the percent at the end of it


*use item as the subject of your sentence
*percent
*of 
*the whole



Sample: 
Australian household energy use(book 10, tes1) 

item = heating
the whole = Australian household energy use
he bridge = is used by

the whole + 
Australian household energy is used by heating

percent based description:
30 percent of Australian houshold energy is used by water heating
percentage based description:
the percentage of Australian house hold used by  water heating is 30%

item based description:
water heating accounts for/makes up/represents 30% of Australina household energy use




step 2: write a clause
subject + verb

step3:identify the context


the percent+ of + the whole + the bridge + the item




1- Percent Based Description:

Book 14, Test 1

1-1: Having gotten rid of percentage or percentages, write a clause(subject + verb) about the topic that is being discussed.

Average percentage of sodium, 

Sodium is consumed in three typical meals in the USA.
Sodium is consumend in dinner. 
the consumption of sodium in dinner
sodium consumption in dinner




contexts: ownership




context: source

sodium is consumed in typical meals in the USA
the consumption of sodium
sodium consumption


43 percent of sodium is consumed in dinner
43 percent of sodium consumption is in dinner. 
the percentage of sodium consumed in dinner stands at/is 43%
dinner accounts for 43% of sodium consumption
the figure for dinner stands at/is 43%

dinner accounts for 43% of 



10 percent of the global market share belongs to iPhones.
10 percent of US prisoners are men.

What is the difference between these two sentences?
Why in the first sentence 'belongs' has been used, while in the second sentence 'are' is the main
verb??? Can we use 'belong' for the first sentence, and vice versa. 

At the end of this article, you will be able to answers these very important questions. 

For now, let's quickly learn the major players in this type of comparison pattern by using an example:


EX: iPhones account for 10% of the global market share.

The four major players are as follows:
the item -> iPhones
a verb -> account for 
the proportion -> 10%
the whole -> the global market share

Now that you can identify the majore players, let's base the subcategories of TPCP on each major
palyer, starting with the item.  

1- Item Based Description:
In this type of camparison pattern, the item is the subject of the sentence.

 
iPhones have 27.7% of the global market share. 
iPhones hold 27.7% of the global market share.
iPhones account for 27.7% of the gobal market share.
iPhones represent 27.7% of the global market share.
iPhones comprise  27.7% of the global market share.
iPhones constitute  27.7% of the global market share.
iPhones make up 27.7% of the global market share.

here is the formula: 

item +  one of the aforementioned verbs + proportion + of + the whole

To memorize the list of verbs, you may use the acronym:
CHH CAMR -> chh camera
comprise - hold - have    constitute - account for - make up - represent   


1- Item Based Description: 

There are players 

item + have + proportion + of + the whole(total)

There six verbs which are most frequently used so that an item refers to a portion of a total. 
the formula:
item + one of the six verbs + portion + of + total 


With the item being 'iPhones' and '27.7%' being the portion, in this case, 'the global market share'
refers to the total.  

we may use the same structure for human beings as well.  

Men account for/make up/represent/comprise/represent/constitute 60% of US prisoners.

  



2- Percent-based description:






So far, so good! Now, before moving on to the remaining description, you need to learn the
concept of hierarchical superordinate/subordinate categorization, in which items are organized into
a tree-like structure whereby general categories include more specific categories. For example,
a human is a superoridante that includes a man and a woman. Knowing that it is time to move on to
the next step.

Although not as streightforward as the previous example, to identify which item refers to a broader
category is not very difficult. 
a man is superdinate to prisoners
Therefore, we can use the following formula:

portion + of + total(subordinate) + to be + item(subordinate)

60% of prisoners are men.

In contrast, if the item is not a superordinate to total or if they are completely in different
categories, the use of the previous formula is almost impossible. For example, not only are not
iPhones subordiantes to the global market share, but also they are in completely different
categories.

 
27.7% of the goblal market share is iphones.(incorrect)
Instead, we my use the verb 'belong' to connect to categories. 
27.7% of the globlal market share belongs(if the preidicate is not a superordinate to the subject) to iPhones.

ut we cannot say:
Male prisoners are 27.7%.(incorrect)

the combination of total percentage comparsion pattern and list comparison pattern is
invetable

3- Percentage Based Description
the percentage + of + item(used either as an adjective or a possessor) + the whole + linking verb +
proportion
Also:
iPhones'global market share is 27.7%.
iphones'global market share stands at 27.7%. 
The global market share of iPhones is 27.7%.
The global market share of iPhones stands at 27.7%. 

Since Tehranian Polymath's mission is to provide you with a new perpective on the process of recalling
information, it has tried to classify the ways whereby you can describe pie charts, with the
strategy itself being called Total Percentage Comparison pattern(TPCP).

Prior to talking about the classifaction, I want you to look at the following examples in which the key to
this type of comparison pattern lies. 



note: sometimes the percentage refers to subject doing something
