Total Percentage Comparison Pattern:


In order to tackle the process of describing pie charts smartly, you should find the patterns being
repeated in the sentences describing statistical information represented in this medium.
Tehranina Polymath has identified the algorithms whose sequences create the pattern, labelled Total
Percentage Comparison Pattern.

There are three algorithms which are most frequently used in this type of pattern. 

first: percent based description
the formula:
the percent + of + the whole + the bridge + the item

second: percentage based description
the formula:

third: item base description
the formula:

Going through IELTS samples, you will learn thses algorithms with which you can boot your morale. 

Percent Based Description

Book 10, Test 1


step 1: 
*extract the main topic and call it 'the whole'
the whole = 'Australina household energy use'
step 2:
*reverse-engineer the whole if need
'Australian household energy use' is a quiet complicated noun phrase. So let's make it simple using
'reverse-eginneering'. 
reverse-engineering: converting a noun phrase into an abstract noun phrase.
To do that, you should find the most right noun and find out whether its origin is a verb.
With the right most noun being 'use', we are pretty sure that the root is a verb. 
The next step is to bring it to the beginning of the phrase and add a specific determiner, in this
case 'the',  to it. 
the use of Australian household energy
step 3:
needing a clause(subject + verb) to answer this task one question, we should convert this abstract
noun phrase into a clause. To do that, we should a have subject. Let's find out whether we extract a
subject from this abstract noun phrase. 
the use of Australian household energy
'of Australian household enery' could be both the subject in 'of phrase form' and the object in 'of phrase
form. Eihter away, we should get rid of the and see 'use' as a verb 
Let try both of them:
subject: Australian household energy is used
object: * use Australian household enery.
It is a good idea to stick with the subject option so that we don't make the process harder by
adding a new word to this. Therefore, let's assign it to the whole varible. 
the whole = Australian household energy is used
step 4:
Now, let's find the second variable in our alorithm. Looking at the pie chart, you may choose
heating, cooling, lighting, water heating, refrigeration, or other appliances.
Let's choose 'heating' and assing it to a variable called item. 
item = heating
step 5:
In this stage, we should build the 'bridge'.
To do that, we should figure the context in which statistical data is being represented. 
Thankfully, the number of pie charts'contexts is limited. I am going to introduce them to you one at
a time. Look at the question:'The first chart below shows how energy is used'. The word 'how'
indicates the context. 'how' is a clear sign of means or methods. 
The propositions that describe 'means' are as follows: by/via/through/with/by dint of/by means of
In our case 'by' seems to be the best option. Let's pick this one over others.
bridge = by
the whole + the bridge + the item
Australian household energy is used + by + heating
step 6:
In the final stage, we should fit the last piece of puzzle by looking a the proportion of heating
which is 42%.
the percent+ of + the whole(clause) + the bridge + the item
42% + of Australian household energy is used + by + heating.
Now, let's write our sentence:
42% of Australian household energy is used by heating. 

done

Percentage Based Description:

step 1:

the whole(noun phrase) + the adjectival bridge + the item 
Australian household energy +  which is used by + heating

step 2:
the whole(noun phrase) + the reduced adjectival bridge + the item
Australian household energy + used by + heating

step 3:
adding the subject and the verb to create a clause
the percentage + of + the whole + the adjectival bridge + the item + linking verbs + percent
the percentage + of + Australian household energy + used by heate + stands at/is + 42%.


Item Based Description:

the item + CCAMRA verbs + percent + of + the whole(noun phrase)
*CCAMRA is an acronyme for consitute, comprise, account for, make up, represnet, be attributed to.
However, ARM, standing for account for, make up, represent are suitable for almost all contexts.
Hence, stick to them.

Heating accounts for/makes up/represents 42% of Australian household enegy use.

Final note:
Since 'Australian household energy use' is quiet bulky, you may also break it down into:

energy which is used by Australian households
after reduction:
energy used by Australian households

You can even make 'Australian households' easier to comprehend by using a prepositional phrase having
an adjectival function:
households in Australia



Figure Based Description:

Lastly, 'the figure for' is a term which could be used generically among almost all statistical
explanations. 
The figure for + item + linking verbs + the percent

The figure for heating is/stands at 42%.
