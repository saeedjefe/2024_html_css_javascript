Prior to writing the body, we should recall what we have already written in our overview.

Overall, the trend in chicken consumption was upward, while lamb consumption exhibited a downward movement.
Conversely, there were fluctuations in beef consumption, whereas that of fish remained constant.

Tehranian Polymath's suggestion is that the same pattern of comparison is used in the body. In other
words, we have two sentences, each of which can be the blue print of two separate paragraphs, with
the main focus of the first paragraph being on chicken and lamb consumption, the second on beef and
fish. 

Time is inherently part of a line graph usually apearing on the X axis. To Describe the overall
trend, we look at the starting point and the ending point. 

The overall trend of chicken consmption is upward. 
Chicken consumption began/started at 150 grams per peorson per week in 1979.
Chicken conumpstion increased dramatically by 100 over the following 25 years.
There was an increase of 100 grams in chicken consumption over the following 25 years.    
Chicken consumption finished/eneded at 250 grams per person pre week 2004.

The overall trend of chicken consmption is upward. 
After Chicken consumption began/started at 150 grams per peorson per week in 1979, chicken conumpstion increased
dramatically by 100 over the follwoing 25years before chicken consumption finished/eneded at 250 grams per person
per week 2004.

After starting at 150 grams per peorson per week in 1979, chicken conumpstion increased
dramatically by 100 over the following 25 years before, finishing at 250 grams per person
per week in i2004.

Chicken consumption began/started at 150 grams per peorson per week in 1979,
and after an increase of 100 grams over the following 25 years, it reach 250 grams per
person per week in  2004.



The overall trend of lamb is downward. 
Lamb consumption began at 150 grams per peorson per week in 1979.
Lamb conumpstion decreased substantially by 100 over the following 25 years.  
Chicken consumption finished at 250 grams per person pre week 2004.


The overall trend of lamb consumption is upward. 
Lamb consumption began at 150 grams per person per week in 1979, and after a substantial decrease of 100 grams over
the next 25 years, it fell to 50 grams per person per week in 2004. 


There was volatility in beef consumption.
Beef consumption started at 210 grams per person per month. 
Beef consmption decreased shraply to 180 grams in 1981. 
Beef consumption peaked at 240 grams in 1984.
Beef consumption dipped(just for a short time)to 230 in 1985.
Beef consumption rebounded to where it was in 1984 in the following year.
Beef consumpton flattened/stabalized at the same rate for three consecutive years.
Beef consumption dropped by 80 grams over the remaining years.
Beef consumption finished at 100 gramms in 2004. 

Now, it is time to merge senteces. But to do that, we have to first identify the adverbial
reltionships between them. With all these variations taking place over time, 
we can say that there is coronological order between sentence. To adverb time clauses, you may need
to read the article adressing time clauses. 

Let's go throug sentences and start connecting them using linguisitic tools.

Beef consumption started at 210 grams per person per month. Then, even though it decreased shraply to 180 grams. 
it peaked at 240 grams. Thereafter, although it dipped to 230, it rebounded to where it was in 1984.
After that, it flattened at the same rate before it dropping by 80 grams. Finally, it reached an all time low
of 60 grems in 2004. 

Although sentences are connected using either conjuctions or adverbs, the excessive use of 'it'
seems to make the reading of the sentences difficult.

Now, we need to leverage 'reductions' so that we can get rid of all the 'it'. 

The first sentce is an independent clause. Therefore, we should leave it out.

Now look at the second sentence:

Then, even though it decreased shraply to 180 grams, it peaked at 240 grams. 

Even though alhough is a subordinate conjunction, we don't typicall reduce the classes expressing
concession because phillosphically speaking it concession creates distance between two items, unline
cause and time. Hovewer, we may use the propositional version of although which is 'despite'.

There was volatility in beef consumption. Beef consumption started at 210 grams per person per month. Then, 
despite decreasing shraply to 180 grams, it peaked at 240 grams before dipping to 230. However, having rebounded to where it was
in 1984, beef consumption flattend at the same rate befor a drop of 80 gram, reaching an all time
low of 60 grams in 2004. 

There was volatility in beef consumption.
Beef consumption started at 210 grams per person per week in 1979.
Beef consmption declined shraply but briefly to 180 grams in 1981. 
Beef consumption had recovered and peaked at 240 grams by 1984.
Beef consumption dipped back to its inital level the follwoing year.
Beef consumption recovered to 235 grams in 1985.
Beef consumpton flattened/stabalized at the same rate for three consecutive years.
Beef consumption decrease consistently and significantly by 140 grams over the remaining years.
Beef consumption  finished at 100 gramms in 2004. 

Beef consumption started at 210 grams per person per week in 1979. Then, despite a brief but sharp
decline to 180 grams in 1981, it recovered and peaked at 240 grams in 1984 before dipping back to its
initial level the following year. However, in 1985, beef consumption recovered to 235 grams at
which it stabilized for three consecutive years prior to its consistent and significant decrease of
140 grams over the remaining years, finishing at 100 grams in 2004.  


Fish consumption remained constant.
Fish consumption started at 50 grams in 1979. 
Fish consumption stayed at the same rate over the following years.
