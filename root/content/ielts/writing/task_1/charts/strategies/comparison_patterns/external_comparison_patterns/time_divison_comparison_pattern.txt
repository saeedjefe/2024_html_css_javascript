Time Division Comparison Pattern:

Time is an intrinsic value of  line graphs, being always present on X axis. Therefore, to describe
line graphs, you should have a good understanding of time clauses. You may read the artilce
addressing time clauses by clicking on this link so that you are armed with this knowledge prior to
tackling line graphs. 

Based on Tehranian Polymath's methodology, generally speaking, comparison patterns could be either
interanl or external. If you see only one line on a graph, taking time divisions into consideration,
you may compare the line with itself.


However, if you zome out, you can see the big picture. This big picture could be lablled as 
the overall or general trend or the general pattern. In fact, to refer to all of them, we are going to use theterm ' the big picture'. 

'The big picutre' could appear in four different states: upward(adj), downward(adj),
volatile(adj), and stable(adj). With these states being all adjectives, we can write our first
formula regarding line graphs:

the big picture + to be + states

Ex: 
the overall trend is stable

Nevertheless, this formula dosen't work because every line on a graph represents a topic whose name
should be included in our formula. But how can we add the name of topic being in question to our
formula. Well, the answer lies in a preposition whose funcion is adjectival modifying the big
picture. In this case, the preposition that can be used universally is 'in'. 

Thus, lets' revise our formula:

the + overall + trend + in + the item + to be + state adjectives

The overall trend in chicken consumption was upward.
The overall trend in chicken consumption was downward.  
The general trend in chicken consumpton was volatile.
The overall trend in chicken consumption was stable.

an increase in chicken consumption

there + to be + an + overall + state adjectives + trend + in + the item

There was an overall downward trend in chicken consumption.
There was an overall upward trend in chicken consumption.
There was an overall volatile trend in chicken consumption.
There was an overll stable trend in chicken consumption.

there was an increase in chicken consumption

the item + show/exhibit/demonstrate + an + overall + state adjectives + trend

Chicken consumption showed an overall downward trend.
Chicken consumption showed an overall upward trend.
Chicken consumption showed an overall volatile trend.
Chicken consumption showed an overall stable trend.

chicken consumption showed an increase

The + overall + trend + in + item + showed/exhibited/demonstrated + a state noun phrase

The overall trend in chicken consumption showed/exhibited/demonstrated an upward movement.
The overall trend in chicken consumption showed/exhibited/demonstrated a downward trajectory.
The overall trend in chicken consumption showed/exhibited/demonstrated volatility/fluctuations. 
The overall trend in chicken consumption showed/exhibited/demonstrated statbility. 



the + state ajective + trend + in + item + passive verbs(expressing observation).

An upward trend in chicken consumption was observed.
A downward trend in chicken consumption was observed.
A volatile trend in chicken consumption was observed.
A stable trend in chicken consumption was observed. 


an increase in chicken consumption was recorded/reported.
