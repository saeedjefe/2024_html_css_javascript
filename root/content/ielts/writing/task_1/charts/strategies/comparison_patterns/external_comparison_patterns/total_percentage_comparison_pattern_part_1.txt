Total Percentage Comparison Pattern:


In order to tackle the process of describing pie charts smartly, you should find the patterns being
repeated in the sentences describing statistical information represented in this medium.
Tehranian Polymath has identified the algorithms whose sequences create the pattern, labelling them
as Total Percentage Comparison Pattern.

There are three algorithms which are most frequently used in this type of pattern. 

first: percent based description
the formula:
the percent + of + the whole + the adverbial bridge + the item

second: percentage based description
the formula:
the percentage + of + the whole + the adjectival bridge + the item + linking verbs + percent

third: item based description
the formula:
the item + CCAWCB(other verbs are also possible depending on the context) + percent + of + the whole


Going through IELTS samples, you will learn thses algorithms with which you can boot your morale. 

Percent Based Description

Book 10, Test 1


step 1: 
*extract the main topic and call it 'the whole'
the whole = 'Australina household energy use'
step 2:
*reverse-engineer the whole if need
'Australian household energy use' is a quiet complicated noun phrase. So let's make it simple using
'reverse-eginneering'. 
reverse-engineering: converting a noun phrase into an abstract noun phrase.
To do that, you should find the most right noun and find out whether its origin is a verb.
With the right most noun being 'use', we are pretty sure that the root is a verb. 
The next step is to bring it to the beginning of the phrase and add a specific determiner, in this
case 'the',  to it. 
the use of Australian household energy
step 3:
needing a clause(subject + verb) to answer this task one question, we should convert this abstract
noun phrase into a clause. To do that, we should a have subject. Let's find out whether we extract a
subject from this abstract noun phrase. 
the use of Australian household energy
'of Australian household enery' could be both the subject in 'of phrase form' and the object in 'of phrase
form. Eihter away, we should get rid of the and see 'use' as a verb 
Let try both of them:
subject: Australian household energy is used
object: * use Australian household enery.
It is a good idea to stick with the subject option so that we don't make the process harder by
adding a new word to this. Therefore, let's assign it to the whole varible. 
the whole = Australian household energy is used
step 4:
Now, let's find the second variable in our alorithm. Looking at the pie chart, you may choose
heating, cooling, lighting, water heating, refrigeration, or other appliances.
Let's choose 'heating' and assing it to a variable called item. 
item = heating
step 5:
In this stage, we should build the 'bridge'.
To do that, we should figure the context in which statistical data is being represented. 
Thankfully, the number of pie charts'contexts is limited. I am going to introduce them to you one at
a time. Look at the question:'The first chart below shows how energy is used'. The word 'how'
indicates the context. 'how' is a clear sign of means or methods. 
The propositions that describe 'means' are as follows: by/via/through/with/by dint of/by means of
In our case, 'by' seems to be the best option. Let's pick this one over others.
bridge = by
the whole + the bridge + the item
Australian household energy is used + by + heating
step 6:
In the final stage, we should fit the last piece of puzzle by looking a the proportion of heating
which is 42%.
the percent+ of + the whole(clause) + the bridge + the item
42% + of Australian household energy is used + by + heating.
Now, let's write our sentence:
42% of Australian household energy is used by heating. T

done

Percentage Based Description:

step 1:

the whole(noun phrase) + the adjectival bridge + the item 
Australian household energy +  which is used by + heating

step 2:
the whole(noun phrase) + the reduced adjectival bridge + the item
Australian household energy + used by + heating

step 3:
adding the subject and the verb to create a clause
the percentage + of + the whole + the adjectival bridge + the item + linking verbs + percent
the percentage + of + Australian household energy + used by heate + stands at/is + 42%.


Item Based Description:

the item + CCHARM(other verbs are also possible depending on the context) + percent + of + the whole

Figure Based Description:

The figure for + item + linking verbs + the percent

book 10, test1, part2

percent based description:

step 1: 

extract the main topic, modified and call it 'the whole'

Australian household green house emission

reverse_engineering:

Break the noun phrase into small pieces

figure whether the right-most noun has a verb root

if so, convert the noun phrase into an abstract noun

the emission of Australian household greenhouse gas

find out whether 'Australian household greenhouse gas' is the subject of emssion or the object

subject: Australian household greenhouse gas is emitted

object:subject + emit Australian greenhouse gas

Again, choose the subject version.

it is time the build the bridge:

To do that, you need to find the context.

find the context :

Look at the second sentence of this pie chart description. Wiht 'result from' being used, the
relationship is probably cause and resutl.


the list of  verb phrases introducing cause and result :to result in/to contribute/to lead to/to
cause/to be attributed to/to result from/ to stem from

This time, we should express cause and result, with 'the whole' being the result and 'the
item' being the cause. 

Therefore, the clause version(Australian household greenhouse gas is emitted) doesn't come in handy.
We need engineer it back to its phrase form. 

the emission of Australian household greenhouse gas 
Australian household greenhouse gas emission
 
So far so good!! 

It is time to build the adverbial bridge. 

the whole + the bridge with adverbial function + the item

Australian household greenhouse gas emission results from/ be attibuted to water heating

the final step:

percent + of + the whole + the bridge with adverbial function + the item
32% of Australian household greenhouse gas emissions result from water heating.

After having  introduced emissions  in the introduction, we may avoid redundancy by eliminating
emissions' modifiers. 
Australian household greenhouse gas emssions -> 
greenhouse gas emissions 

The final version:

32% of greenhouse gas emssions result from/are attributed to water heating. 





Percentage based description:

greenhouse gas emssions which result from water heating

afte reduction:

greenhouse gas emssions resulting from water heating 

the percentage+of+ the whole + the adjectival bridge + the item + linking verbs(stand at or is) + percent.

the percetage of greenhouse gas emssions resulting from water heating stands at/is 32%. 


item based description:

item + CCHVWE(context-oriented verbs) + percent  + of + the whole
Water heating results in 32% of emssions.

done



We are not done yet. The total percentage pattern on its own is not enough to describe pie charts. 

Writing pie charts requires a mixture of total pattern and list comparison pattern.
