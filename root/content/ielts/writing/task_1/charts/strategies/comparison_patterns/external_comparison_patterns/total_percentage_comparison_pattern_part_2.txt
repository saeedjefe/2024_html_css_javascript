he total percentage pattern on its own is not enough to describe pie charts.

Writing pie charts requires a mixture of total pattern and list comparison pattern.


In case of not  having read 'the list comparison pattern' article yet, it is a good time to do so.

Are you ready?? Now, let's combine the 'total percentage comparison pattern' with 'list comparison
pattern'.

Typically, we start from the greatest and then go further down the list.

the first pie chart:

1-percentage based description + list comparison pattern:

two indepedent clauses:
The greatest share/percentage/proportion of Australian household energy is used by heating.
Heating stands at 42%.

an independet clause + an adjective clause:
The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating, which stands at 42%.

an independet clause + recduction of an adjective clause:
The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating, standing at 42%.

Stand is semantic extension, meaning that 'heating' doesn't stand at 42%. With 'stand' expressing
neither an action nor an emotion, it is a linking verb. Therefore, it can be replaced with 'to be'.

Let's do that:
The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating, which is at 42%.

Let's reduce it:
The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating, being at 42%.

Finally, we can get rid of 'being', a pure linking verb.

The greates percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating, at 42%.

2- Percentage list description + list comparison pattern + item based description:

 an independent clause +  an independent clause
The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating. Heating accounts for 42% of Australian household energy use.

an independet clause + an adjective clause
The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating which accounts for 42% of
Australian household energy use.

an independe cluase + reduction of an adjective clause
The greatest percentage of Australian household energy is used by heating, accounting for 42% of
Australian household energy use.


3- item based description + list comparison pattern + item based description

(percentage based description + list comparison pattern)  + item based description:

the greatest share/percentage/proportion of Australian household energy is used by heating.
heating accounts for 42% of the total

reduction:
The greatesst share of Australian household energy is used by heating, accounting for 42%.


(Context-Item Based Description + List Comparison Pattern) + Item Based Description:

Heating consumes the greatest proportion of Australian household energy.
Heating accounts for 42% of the total.

reduction:

Heating consumes the greatest proportion of Australian household energy, accounting for 42% of the
total.


Now we can go down the list by talking about the second greatest proportion.
Let's choos one of the senetence in the previous part.

Heating consumes the greatest proportion of Australian household energy, accounting for 42% of the
total.

This is followed by water heating + item based description
This is followed by water heating + context based description
This is followed by water heating +


Now, introducing contrast,  you can now address the item with the smallest percentage and other
items in the pie chart.
