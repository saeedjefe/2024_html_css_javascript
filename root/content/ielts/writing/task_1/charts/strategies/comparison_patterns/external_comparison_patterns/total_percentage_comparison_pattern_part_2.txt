1-1: Having gotten rid of percentage or percentages, write a clause(subject + verb) about the topic that is being discussed.

Average percentage of sodium,

Sodium is consumed in three typical meals in the USA.
Sodium is consumend in dinner.
the consumption of sodium in dinner
sodium consumption in dinner




contexts: ownership




context: source

sodium is consumed in typical meals in the USA
the consumption of sodium
sodium consumption


43 percent of sodium is consumed in dinner
43 percent of sodium consumption is in dinner.
the percentage of sodium consumed in dinner stands at/is 43%
dinner accounts for 43% of sodium consumption
the figure for dinner stands at/is 43%

dinner accounts for 43% of



10 percent of the global market share belongs to iPhones.
10 percent of US prisoners are men.

What is the difference between these two sentences?
Why in the first sentence 'belongs' has been used, while in the second sentence 'are' is the main
verb??? Can we use 'belong' for the first sentence, and vice versa.

At the end of this article, you will be able to answers these very important questions.

For now, let's quickly learn the major players in this type of comparison pattern by using an example:


EX: iPhones account for 10% of the global market share.

The four major players are as follows:
the item -> iPhones
a verb -> account for
the proportion -> 10%
the whole -> the global market share

Now that you can identify the majore players, let's base the subcategories of TPCP on each major
palyer, starting with the item.

1- Item Based Description:
In this type of camparison pattern, the item is the subject of the sentence.


iPhones have 27.7% of the global market share.
iPhones hold 27.7% of the global market share.
iPhones account for 27.7% of the gobal market share.
iPhones represent 27.7% of the global market share.
iPhones comprise  27.7% of the global market share.
iPhones constitute  27.7% of the global market share.
iPhones make up 27.7% of the global market share.

here is the formula:

item +  one of the aforementioned verbs + proportion + of + the whole

To memorize the list of verbs, you may use the acronym:
CHH CAMR -> chh camera
comprise - hold - have    constitute - account for - make up - represent


1- Item Based Description:

There are players

item + have + proportion + of + the whole(total)

There six verbs which are most frequently used so that an item refers to a portion of a total.
the formula:
item + one of the six verbs + portion + of + total
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              180,1         63%


Figure Based Description:

Lastly, 'the figure for' is a term which could be used generically among almost all statistical
explanations.
The figure for + item + linking verbs + the percent

The figure for heating is/stands at 42%.



With the item being 'iPhones' and '27.7%' being the portion, in this case, 'the global market share'
refers to the total.

we may use the same structure for human beings as well.

Men account for/make up/represent/comprise/represent/constitute 60% of US prisoners.





2- Percent-based description:






So far, so good! Now, before moving on to the remaining description, you need to learn the
concept of hierarchical superordinate/subordinate categorization, in which items are organized into
a tree-like structure whereby general categories include more specific categories. For example,
a human is a superoridante that includes a man and a woman. Knowing that it is time to move on to
the next step.

Although not as streightforward as the previous example, to identify which item refers to a broader
category is not very difficult.
a man is superdinate to prisoners
Therefore, we can use the following formula:

portion + of + total(subordinate) + to be + item(subordinate)

60% of prisoners are men.

In contrast, if the item is not a superordinate to total or if they are completely in different
categories, the use of the previous formula is almost impossible. For example, not only are not
iPhones subordiantes to the global market share, but also they are in completely different
categories.


27.7% of the goblal market share is iphones.(incorrect)
Instead, we my use the verb 'belong' to connect to categories.
27.7% of the globlal market share belongs(if the preidicate is not a superordinate to the subject) to iPhones.

ut we cannot say:
Male prisoners are 27.7%.(incorrect)

the combination of total percentage comparsion pattern and list comparison pattern is
invetable

3- Percentage Based Description
the percentage + of + item(used either as an adjective or a possessor) + the whole + linking verb +
proportion
Also:
iPhones'global market share is 27.7%.
iphones'global market share stands at 27.7%.
The global market share of iPhones is 27.7%.
The global market share of iPhones stands at 27.7%.

Since Tehranian Polymath's mission is to provide you with a new perpective on the process of recalling
information, it has tried to classify the ways whereby you can describe pie charts, with the
strategy itself being called Total Percentage Comparison pattern(TPCP).

Prior to talking about the classifaction, I want you to look at the following examples in which the key to
this type of comparison pattern lies.



note: sometimes the percentage refers to subject doing something
